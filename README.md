# yazio-mcp-server

An MCP server over the [YAZIO](https://www.yazio.com) food diary. Ask a model
what you have eaten today, log a meal, build a recipe from tracked products.

Hand-written, unlike the SDK it sits on: it exists to turn ~48 raw endpoints
into a couple of dozen tools a model can use without a manual, which is
judgement work a generator cannot do.

Built on [yazio-sdk](https://github.com/yazio-community/yazio-sdk-python), which
is generated from
[yazio-api-specification](https://github.com/yazio-community/yazio-api-specification).

## Running it

```bash
pip install yazio-mcp-server
yazio-mcp-server
```

Or from a checkout:

```bash
nix-shell --run "make run"
```

Or in a container:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The endpoint is `http://127.0.0.1:8931/mcp`, speaking streamable HTTP. The port
avoids 8000 on purpose — that one collides with too much other tooling for a
server whose URL is registered somewhere in advance.

## In a container

The `Dockerfile` builds an Alpine image that runs the server as an unprivileged
user (uid 10001) and holds nothing but the interpreter and the installed
virtualenv — 60 MB on disk, 21 MB to pull. It binds `0.0.0.0`, because a
container's own loopback is reachable from nothing else.

One thing the image does that a plain `pip install` does not: it removes
`cryptography` after installing. That package is 15 MB and arrives through
`mcp` → `pyjwt[crypto]`, for OAuth and JWT verification paths a Basic-auth
server never takes — PyJWT falls back to its HMAC-only algorithm set, and TLS to
YAZIO goes through the standard library's `ssl` either way. Adding an OAuth path
to this server means dropping that line from the `Dockerfile` first.

Tagged releases are published to GHCR for amd64 and arm64, so there is usually
nothing to build:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:8931:8931 ghcr.io/yazio-community/yazio-mcp-server:latest
```

`v1.4.2` publishes `1.4.2`, `1.4` and `1`; `latest` follows final releases only,
never a prerelease. From a checkout:

```bash
docker build -t yazio-mcp-server .
docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:8931:8931 yazio-mcp-server
```

The one thing worth knowing before deploying it: **every hostname clients use to
reach the server has to be named.** The transport's DNS-rebinding guard accepts
loopback and nothing more, so a compose service name, a Kubernetes Service or an
Ingress host all come back as `421 Invalid Host header` until they are added:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8931:8931 yazio-mcp-server \
  yazio-mcp-server --host 0.0.0.0 --allowed-host yazio.example.com
```

`docker-compose.yml` does exactly this for the service name and publishes the
port on loopback only — the credentials in play are a YAZIO password in
reversible encoding, so anything wider belongs behind TLS.

On Kubernetes the same argument goes in `args`, and probes have to be TCP: the
whole app sits behind Basic auth, so an unauthenticated HTTP probe reports 401
for a healthy server.

```yaml
containers:
  - name: yazio-mcp
    image: yazio-mcp-server
    args: ["yazio-mcp-server", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--allowed-host", "yazio-mcp.default.svc.cluster.local:*"]
    ports:
      - containerPort: 8931
    readinessProbe:
      tcpSocket:
        port: 8931
    securityContext:
      runAsNonRoot: true
      readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
      allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
```

Nothing is written to disk and no state survives a restart — tokens are cached
in memory, per credential pair — so replicas need no coordination and can be
scaled freely.

## Using it from Claude Code

Registered at user scope, so it is available in every directory:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http --scope user yazio http://127.0.0.1:8931/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Basic $(printf '%s:%s' "$YAZIO_USERNAME" "$YAZIO_PASSWORD" | base64 -w0)"
```

The server has to be running for Claude Code to reach it; start it with the
command above, and it will show as failed in `claude mcp list` when it is not.

Note that this writes the Basic credential into `~/.claude.json`, where it sits
in a form that is trivially reversible — it is your YAZIO password, not a token
you can revoke on its own. `claude mcp remove yazio --scope user` takes it back
out.

## Authenticating

There is no separate account for this server: clients authenticate with the same
username and password they use to log in to YAZIO, sent as HTTP Basic
credentials. The server exchanges them for a YAZIO OAuth token on the first tool
call and caches it per credential pair until it expires.

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "yazio": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8931/mcp",
      "headers": {
        // base64 of "username:password"
        "Authorization": "Basic bWVAZXhhbXBsZS5jb206aHVudGVyMg=="
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Basic auth is not what the MCP specification prescribes for HTTP transports — it
expects OAuth — so clients have to be pointed at the server with an explicit
header rather than through a discovery flow.

Basic credentials are encoded, not encrypted. Bind to loopback, or terminate TLS
in front of the server; never expose it over plain HTTP on a network you do not
control.

Behind a reverse proxy, name the public hostname or the transport's DNS-rebinding
guard will reject the request:

```bash
python3 -m yazio_mcp --host 0.0.0.0 --allowed-host yazio.example.com
```

| `browse_recipes` | YAZIO's editorial catalogue for a country |
| `get_favorite_recipes` | Recipes marked as favourites |

**Profile**

`get_profile` returns the goal direction, activity level, units, height and
birth date — context worth having before interpreting anyone's numbers.

## Units

Energy is in kilocalories and macros are in **grams**. Vitamins and minerals are
reported in **milligrams**: YAZIO stores them in grams too, but at that scale they
are values like 0.00012 that round away to nothing. Every nutrient block carries a
`units` map, so the mixture cannot be misread.

Micronutrients stay small even in milligrams, because product nutrients are per
one base unit (see below) rather than per 100. Numbers that would round to zero at
two decimals are reported to three significant digits instead, so a trace amount
never reads as an absent one.

Product nutrients are stored per **one** base unit, not per 100: olive oil reads
8.84 kcal per gram. This is the factor `create_recipe` scales by, so it is worth
knowing before touching that code.

## How `create_recipe` works

YAZIO's recipe endpoint stores what the client submits and derives nothing: a
recipe carries its own nutrient totals. So `create_recipe` resolves every
ingredient to a real product, scales that product's nutrients to the amount the
recipe uses, and sums them before posting. An ingredient that cannot be resolved
fails the call rather than silently contributing zero.

Two of its rules come from the API rather than from taste, and both are enforced
before the request goes out because the API signals them badly:

- **At least two ingredients.** One is rejected with "This collection should
  contain 2 elements or more".
- **`portion_count` must be a whole number.** Not merely integral in value — it
  has to serialise without a decimal point. `2` is accepted; `2.0` and `2.5` are
  both answered with a bare `500` and no message.

## API behaviour this server works around

The full catalogue of undocumented API behaviour lives in the
[spec repo](https://github.com/yazio-community/yazio-api-specification#things-the-api-does-not-document).
These are the ones that shaped code here rather than the spec:

- **The client version is checked, and it lives in the User-Agent.** Anything
  unrecognised gets `403 {"error":"version_blocked"}` on every endpoint except
  the token exchange. `config.USER_AGENT` carries the captured app's string and
  will need bumping when YAZIO retires that version — a sudden wall of 403s is
  the symptom, and it is the single most likely reason this server stops
  working one day.
- **Product search requires `sex` and `countries`.** `search_products` fills
  both from the user's profile rather than making a caller supply them.
- **`untrack_item` cannot trust the delete endpoint.** `DELETE
  /v22/user/consumed-items` takes a body of `{"<bucket>": "<uuid>"}` — a single
  string, not a list — and it also accepts an `?id=` query parameter, answers
  `204`, and does nothing. So the tool looks the entry up first to learn its
  bucket, and reads the day back afterwards rather than believing the status
  code.
- **`create_recipe` validates before sending.** Two API rules are enforced
  client-side because the API signals them badly: fewer than two ingredients is
  rejected with a message about collections, and a `portion_count` that
  serialises with a decimal point (`2.0`, `2.5`) is answered with a bare `500`
  and no message at all.

## Development

```bash
nix-shell            # builds yazio_sdk from its PyPI release
make test            # mocked suite, never touches a real account
make lint
```

`yazio_sdk` comes from PyPI everywhere — the dev shell, CI and released builds
alike. The dev shell pins one version of it (see `shell.nix`); keep that inside
the range `pyproject.toml` declares when either moves.

### Checking it against a live account

The mocked suite is fast and covers the shaping logic, but it cannot catch the
API contradicting the spec. `scripts/smoke_live.py` starts the real server and
drives it as an MCP client — Basic auth, token exchange, SDK and shaping, end to
end:

```bash
printf 'YAZIO_USERNAME=…\nYAZIO_PASSWORD=…\n' > .env   # gitignored
nix-shell --run "make smoke"        # reads only
nix-shell --run "make smoke-write"  # tracks one gram of olive oil, then removes it
```

If a *shape* looks wrong rather than the server's handling of it, the problem is
upstream: use `scripts/probe_live.py` in the spec repo and fix it there.
