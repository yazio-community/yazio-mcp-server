"""Reading, creating, updating and photographing recipes.

Creating and updating are the only tools in this server that are more than a
translation of an API call. YAZIO's recipe endpoints do not compute anything:
the client is expected to submit the finished dish's nutrients alongside its
ingredients. So create_recipe resolves every ingredient, scales its nutrients
to the amount used, and sums them before posting; update_recipe does the same
when new ingredients are given, and otherwise resends what is already stored.
