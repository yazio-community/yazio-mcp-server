"""Tool implementations, grouped the way the YAZIO app groups its features.

Each module exposes a `register(mcp)` function so that server.py stays a list of
registrations rather than a thousand-line file of tool bodies.

Endpoint modules from `yazio_sdk` are imported under an `api_` prefix throughout
this package. Several of them share a name with a tool defined here — the SDK's
`get_product`, `search_products`, `get_goals`, `get_recipe` and `log_exercise`
all do — and because the tools are nested inside `register`, an unprefixed
import would be shadowed by the tool's own closure rather than clashing loudly.
The prefix keeps the two apart, and says at every call site which is which.
