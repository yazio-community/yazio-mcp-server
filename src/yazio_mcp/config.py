The OAuth client credentials are the ones the YAZIO mobile app ships with; they
were read back out of the mitmproxy capture the spec was generated from. They
identify the *app*, not the user — every install sends the same pair — so they
are not a secret and belong in source rather than in the environment. The user's
own credentials never appear here; they arrive per request (see auth.py).
