"""Builds an authenticated YAZIO client for the request a tool is serving.

Credentials are per request, not per process, so a tool cannot hold onto a
long-lived client. Instead it opens one for the duration of a call:

    async with yazio_client(ctx) as client:
        response = await some_endpoint.asyncio_detailed(client=client)
        data = expect_ok(ctx, response, "load the diary")

The credentials are read straight off the Starlette request that the streamable
HTTP transport attaches to the MCP request context. That is deliberate: reading
them from a context variable set in middleware would depend on how the transport
happens to spawn its tasks, whereas the request object is passed through
explicitly and is stable.
