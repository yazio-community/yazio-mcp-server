Tools for a YAZIO food diary: reading what was eaten and how it compares to the
day's goals, searching YAZIO's food database, logging food, water, weight and
activity, and building recipes.

Start with get_daily_summary for how a day is going, get_diary for what was
actually eaten, and get_nutrition_range for trends across days. To log food,
search_products first — tracking needs the product_id that search returns.

Energy is in kilocalories, macros in grams, and vitamins and minerals in
milligrams. Every nutrient block states its own units. Dates are YYYY-MM-DD and
default to today when omitted.
